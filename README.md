## Why is this here?

LARA (Local Area Radar Application) is a sample application I designed
and developed during my enrollment in the Devcelerator Program in
2012. It was developed for iOS 5 but I have since made basic updates so that it will run correctly in iOS 7.

I am posting this project so that others investigating the useage of
CoreLocation Services and Quartzcore can view the source code of a
project centered around these frameworks.
